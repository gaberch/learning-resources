# Learning resources
I realized the importance of having diversified interests in an attempt to accumulate lessons from different fields and
by hearing others (podcasts) recommending the adoption of it. I value open-sourced information and how people share 
lessons they learned through podcasts, books, blogs, etc. To showcase appreciation for all the resources I have access
to, I decided to compile a list of the things I use/d for my own learning so others can develop awareness of them the 
same way I did. The compiled lists are in no particular order, are not comprehensive, and I will update them 
occasionally as I complete readings, discover interesting podcasts, or continue listening to audio books. 

For questions or content (books, podcasts, platforms, etc) recommendations send an email, star this repo, or simply 
reach out to have a chat about interesting things software engineering, life lessons, mentors, triathlon, or whatever 
you want!
